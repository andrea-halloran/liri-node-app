# liri-node-app

This project is a command line node app that takes in and outputs useful information about searchable songs, movie titles, and concerts. I have used the Spotify, OMDB, and Bands In Town APIs to populate this information. 

When users type node liri, they will be prompted with a selection of choices: [spotify-this-song, movie-this, and concert-this]. After choosing which type of information the user would like to retrieve, they are prompted with an option to free text a song name, movie name, or concert. After this information is input, the app will load.
